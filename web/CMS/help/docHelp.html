<UL>
<LI><B>Type:</B> This is used for categorizing the homepage. If the
  document-type is Index, it will automatically print a list of links
  to all its children (see categorization below), and be treated
  special in a number of other ways. All other document types are for
  your own use only, so you can systemize the documents by type,
  making it easier for the user to navigate in your homepage. If you
  want the document to be of a type that does not appear on the list,
  simply click the 'Types' link on the left menu, to create new types.</LI>

used to identify the documents. In the list of documents, for example,

<H3>Categorization</H3>
This is used for categorizing the documents in some sort of
hierarchy. On index-pages, links to the children of a page will be
printed. To edit these relationships between the pages, use the
dropdowns in the very bottom of the page (these will only appear if
you are editing an existing document). To set a parent of a document,
simply select it from the 'SELECT PARENT TO ADD' list, and hit the
'add' button. To remove a parent, select it from 'SELECT PARENT TO
REMOVE' and hit the 'remove' button. If a document has a parent, this
means that the document will appear on the parents list of links to
document.
