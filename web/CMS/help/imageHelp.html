This is used for uploading/editing images. The images are used for showing in the documents, and for flags used by languages.
Images can be uploaded in two versions: big and small. The small version will ALWAYS be shown on the homepage. If you have uploaded a big version of the image, the small image will automatically link to the big one. So -- if you have uploaded two versions of an image, the small one will be shown and clicking on it will take the user to the big version.

<H3><A NAME='edit'>Uploading/editing images</H3>
When hitting the edit or new button you will be redirected to a screen
where you can edit the properties of the new image. If you are
creating a new image, the fields will all be empty, if you are
editing an existing image, more fields will be available, and they will have the relevant
values (if they exist in the selected language). In the upper right corner, flags of the available languages
(as you have added in the language-menu), are printed. Click on the
desired language, to set the translation you are editing.<P>

Below is a description of the fields and what they mean:<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Current small:</B> Shows the image that you have currently set as the small version</LI>
<LI><B>small:</B> If you want to set a new small version of the image, simply hit the 'browse' button to the right of the field, and select the image you want to upload as the 'small' version.</LI>
<LI><B>Current big:</B> Shows the image that you have currently set as the big version</LI>
<LI><B>big: (optional)</B> If you want to set a new big version of the image, simply hit the 'browse' button to the right of the field, and select the image you want to upload as the 'big' version.</LI>
<LI><B>Identifier:</B> This value is used for you only.. The users of the homepage will NOT be able to see this value. It is used when there is a list of the images you have (eg. when choosing flags for languages, images to insert on a page etc). So use descriptive names here - it will make it a lot easier to find the images you need later on.</LI>
</UL>

When you are editing a document, you will furthermore have the following fields available for the different versions of the document:

<UL>
<LI><B>Alternative text:</B> This text is shown when a user puts the mouse on the image.</LI>
</UL>
