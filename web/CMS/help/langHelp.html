<UL>
<LI><B>Name:</B> This is the name of the language (eg. Danish).</LI>
<LI><B>Shorthand:</B> This is the shorthand of the language. If the homepage is using mod rewrite, then this value will be a part of the address. (having 'dk' here on the homepage: www.yourdomain.com will make the address: dk.yourdomain.com when watching a document in danish).</LI>
<LI><B>Flag:</B> This should be an image with the flag of the language you are editing. If you do not have the desired flag on this list, it can be uploaded via the 'Images' link in the left menu.</LI>
<LI><B>Priority:</B> This is the priority of the languages. This dictates what order the choices of languages will be shown to the user. Furthermore, if a document does not exist in the translation the user desires, the translation of the desired document will default to the existing translation with the highest priority.</LI>
